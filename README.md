<h1 align="center">Because mazes are aMAZEing!!!</h1>

## Project description
<p>This project is inspired by the world-famous <a href="http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/" target="_blank">Wolfenstein 3D</a> game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.</p>
